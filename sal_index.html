        <h2>Welcome to the game of Moksha-Patamu, otherwise known as Snake and Ladders!</h2>
        
        <p class="rules">Rules of Game:<br>
            The first player that reaches the highest space on the board, 100, wins the game.<br>
            When you land at the bottom of a ladder, your piece would move up. Landing at the top of a ladder does nothing. 
            <br>When you land at the top of a snake, your piece would move down. Landing at the base of a snake does nothing.<br>
            
            Note that a player will have to roll the exact number required to land their piece on the 100th tile. So if the player rolls a higher number than needed to land exactly on 100, their piece does not move and remains there until their next turn.
